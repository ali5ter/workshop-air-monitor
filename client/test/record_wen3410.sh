# @brief: Script to record IR signals from WEN 3410 remote control.

# To emulate the WEN 3410's remote control, we need to record
# the IR signals it sends. This can be done with an IR receiver
# connected to an RPi GPIO pin, and using LIRC (Linux Infrared
# Remote Control) to capture the signals. Once captured, we can
# use LIRC to send the same signals to control the air filtration
# system.

# Hardware requirements:
# - Raspberry Pi with GPIO pins
# - IR receiver module (e.g., TSOP38238)
#   - Receiver OUT pin connected to GPIO 18 (pin 12)
#   - Receiver VCC pin connected to 3.3V (pin 1)
#   - Receiver GND pin connected to GND (pin 6)
