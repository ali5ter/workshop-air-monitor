# Workshop Climate Monitor

I wanted to monitor the air quality, temperature and pressure of my garage workshop using a single board computer (SBC) like a Raspberry Pi.

As well as controlling my air filtration, sawdust collection and heating systems, I was curious to know baselines for general particulate matter, noxious gasses, pressure and humidity. I also wanted a way to trigger a camera from a motion sensor to record who was going in and out of the workshop.

The collected data is pushed to InfluxDB and then visualized using Grafana.

## Future considerations

I would like to [trigger other services directly using IFTTT](https://platform.ifttt.com/docs/connect_api). For example, turning on the heating system when the temperature drops below a specific reading, or starting a camera when motion is detected.

## Environmental conditions being monitored

### Particulate matter

Inspired by [this article](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/monitor-air-quality-with-a-raspberry-pi/), I figured I could monitor the airbourne sawdust that was not being gathered by my sawdust collection system. If it got above a certain level, I figured I could triger my dust filtration unit.

Using [the SDS011 sensor](https://microcontrollerslab.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/NonA-PM-SDS011-Dust-sensor-datasheet.pdf) I could collect data on two standard sizes of particulate matter (PM). According to [the Air Quality Standards in my area](https://www3.epa.gov/region1/airquality/pm-aq-standards.html), the 10 micron particles (PM<sub>10</sub>) should not exceed 150 micrograms per cubic meter (μg/m3) based on a 24-hour average. Similarly, the small nasty stuff that can really hurt you, the 2.5 micron particles (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) should not exceed 35 micrograms per cubic meter (μg/m3) based on a 24-hour average.

The client code for the SDS011 sensor is [sds011.py](client/env_monitor/sds011.py).

### Temperature, humidity, pressure and gas

Adafruit sell [the amazing BME680](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-bme680-humidity-temperature-barometic-pressure-voc-gas) providing the remaining environmental sensing I wanted.

I took advantage of the adafruit_blinka python library to use the CircuitPython hardware API that talks I2C and SPI protocols that sensors often use. Adafruit [explains this and how to install this lib onto your Linux SBC](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-on-raspberrypi-linux/installing-circuitpython-on-raspberry-pi). As explained below, I provide a script to install the nessesary sensor support. 

The client code for the BME680 sensor is [bme680.py](client/env_monitor/bme680.py).

I wanted a way to compare against current weather conditions, so used the Accuweather Service to fetch data for my location. This does require an Accuweather API access key which [you can register for free](https://developer.accuweather.com) but you're limited to one key and up to 50 API calls per day. The path of where you stored your key and the Accuweather location code are hardcoded in [accuweather.py](client/env_monitor/accuweather.py).

### Motion

I chose to use [the Pyroelectric ("Passive") InfraRed Sensor from Adafruit](https://learn.adafruit.com/pir-passive-infrared-proximity-motion-sensor) to understand if someone was in the workshop. I figured that would be good to cross reference with environmental changes but also wanted a way to trigger a camera to at least understand who was in there.

The client code for the PIR sensor is [pir.py](client/env_monitor/pir.py).

## Server side

InfluxDB is being used to store the sensor data generated by the client side monitor application. Grafana is being used to vizualize this collected data. I used to use AdaFruit IO to do these things but couldn't afford the ongoing subscription.

The InfluxDB and Grafana services can be stood up as container based apps using Docker on a seperate system or the one running the monitor.

The [start_influx_grafana.sh](server/start_influx_grafana.sh) script will start up these services as Docker containers.

The configuration for InfluxDB and Granfana is in [influx_grafana_config.env](server/influx_grafana_config.env). Change this accordingly before you run the start script. These parameters will be used in the instructions below.

### Configure InfluxDB

1. Open the InfluxDB UI and log in using the configured username and password. You will land in the configured org by default and buckets will already be defined if you've used the start up script mentioned above.
2. Create a bucket using the name configured in the script.
3. Generate a write token, if you don't want to use the Admin's Token already set up by the script, and save that to ~/.config/influxdb-token on the system where the client monitor will run.

## Client side

The monitor application, [env_monitor.pl](client/env_monitor.py) runs on the client side. It runs on a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 with the environmental sensors described above attached.

The [install_sensor_support.sh](client/install_sensor_support.sh) script uses apt and pip to install libraries so that the python application running on the RPi can talk to the envornmental sensors. You only have to run this once and reboot the RPi to make sure the changes have taken before running the monitoring application.

You may get a warning saying, "Kernel module 'spi-dev' not found". Ignore that.

After the sensor support is established, you can use [the test scripts](/client/test/) to see if the attached sensors are working.

Note that in my hardware implementation, the PIR sensor was connected to GPIO pin 4.
